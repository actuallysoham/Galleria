# Galleria

A clean dashboard to interface with the Harvard Museum API. In this application, the images in the Harvard Art Museum's online collection is arranged according to the century they belong to. The most popular painitng/ artworks from each century is indexed and, user may get additional information about the artwork by hovering over it. Images also contain a link to the original location, as provided (and required) by the API. 

Why *Galleria*? Coz it's the Italian for Gallery. Yeah no, that's it. 

## Usage

For now, please clone the repository and run the timeline.html file. I'll host it shortly, after fixing a few issues.

### Issues to be resolved

* Add a shuffle functionality
* Read up about async/ promises etc. Implement the calls properly (currently, it's very 'hacky').
* Add some padding to the text - it looks ugly when it overflows (although it can scroll).

## Key Learnings

* Learned a lot about APIs and how to work with them.
* Revised CSS Layouts.
* Got to read up about http calls and methods.
